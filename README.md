## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## In 2024 I graduated from Tver State University and received the qualification of "Information Security Specialist".
## At the university we programmed in C++ with a mathematical bias. I am also familiar with the SQL programming language. But I don't want to stop there and I strive for new knowledge, so at the moment I am taking the course "Neural Network Developer".
